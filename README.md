# javascriptQuiz

## Overview
This assingment was given to us to help us understand webApis. This last week was a bit challenging and frustrating to use the different lines of codes to put things into local storage or to take things out. After this assingment I am more comfortable with this topic.

My motivation for this project was to better understand the basics of webApi's

I created this assignment because lots of people even me sometimes forget the basics of html css and js. It's nice to go through and relearn everything.

I learned how to put things into local storage and to take it out on a different html. I also learned alot more about how to use flex which wasnt apart of the assingment but it was a huge help

## Credits
Credits go out to AskBCS because without them I would of not been able to finish this assignment.
